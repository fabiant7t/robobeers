# Robobeers

Robobeers is a meetup format at Seestadt to learn and explore robotics.
This repo is supposed to document the journey. Here is [Fabian's journey](https://github.com/fabiant7t/robobeers/blob/main/fabian/docs/Index.md).

You can open the `docs` folder as a vault in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), it's a markdown wiki.
